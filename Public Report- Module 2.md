# Module 2 - Application Development

## Introduction

During Sprint 2, the focus was on the development of the main application. The technological architecture consisted of a frontend developed with React Native and a backend implemented with FastAPI. For content generation, the system utilizes pictograms provided by the ARASAAC API and creates stories through the Gemini model.

## Development

A primary workstream was the development of a proprietary image recognition model using BLIP. Initially, the results were unsatisfactory. The analysis identified that the failure stemmed from the improper use of the iCartoonFace database and an insufficient number of training epochs. As a next step, the creation of a proprietary database is planned. This new database will aim to improve the model, enabling the recognition of cartoons and characters, as well as including images from a child's daily life, such as therapy and school scenes.

In parallel, a validation of the application was conducted with Professor Marília Othero from USP as a final review. During this validation, a high accuracy in pictogram identification was observed. However, the need for adjustments to the application was pointed out. One of the recommendations was to verify the images generated by ARASAAC, as some may not be suitable for the child audience. Additionally, the project has been submitted to the ethics council for review.

## Conclusion

At the end of Sprint 2, the team has a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that is ready for testing. However, there is a consensus that adjustments are necessary to enhance the user experience. The next steps will focus on the development of the image recognition model based on an open-source framework and the new database, as well as implementing the improvements suggested during the validation phase.
