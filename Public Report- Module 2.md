# Sprint 2 Progress Report

## Application Development

During Sprint 2, the core application was developed. The frontend was built using **React Native**, while the backend was implemented with **FastAPI**.

For content generation, the system utilizes pictograms sourced from the **ARASAAC API** and generates stories using the **Gemini** model.

## Model Development & Challenges

An attempt was made to develop a proprietary image identification model using **BLIP**. However, the results were significantly poor. The main reasons identified for this failure were:
* Incorrect use of the iCartoonFace dataset.
* An insufficient number of training epochs.

The next steps for improving the model are:
* Generating a proprietary database to enhance the model. This database will focus on recognizing cartoon images and characters.
* Incorporating images from a child's daily life, such as therapy sessions, school environments, etc.

## Validation and Feedback

A final review of the application was conducted with **Professor Mar√≠lia Othero from USP**. Key observations from this validation include:

* **High Accuracy:** The system demonstrated a high level of accuracy in identifying and suggesting pictograms.
* **Need for Adjustments:** Despite the high accuracy, some adjustments are necessary for a better user experience.
* **Image Verification:** It was noted that some images generated by ARASAAC may not be suitable for children, requiring a verification step to ensure appropriateness.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

A viable **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is ready for testing. However, adjustments are required to improve the overall user experience.

Future work will focus on:
* Developing the image recognition model using an open-source framework and the new proprietary dataset.
* Implementing the necessary adjustments based on expert feedback.
* Awaiting review and approval from the **ethics council**, to which the project has already been submitted.
