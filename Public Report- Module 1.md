# Module 1 - Discover and Understanding Solution

## Introduction

Technological advancement has transformed many areas, especially in the context of accessibility and inclusion. This project is part of a scientific research initiative that aims to understand how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can impact the communication of nonverbal autistic children. It focuses on the application of AI within Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) methodologies. The goal is to develop a solution that allows children, particularly those with difficulties in verbalization, to communicate more efficiently and independently, using simple technologies.

The project aims not only to offer an innovative option to traditional AAC technologies, such as the GoTalk20+, but also to understand the effectiveness of using AI to generate pictograms and stimulate children's speech from photos or text. The development of this application considers accessibility and usability for the target audience, with the promise of a solution that significantly contributes to the school inclusion of these children.

## Development

Below is the description of what was done in each project sprint, including the start date of each phase:

| Sprint   | Start Date | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sprint 1 | 02/14       | Project plan preparation, topic justification, type of research, and execution planning. |
| Sprint 2 | 02/28       | Market study and academic references, mapping existing solutions and identifying innovation opportunities. |
| Sprint 3 | 03/14       | Development of innovative methodologies for nonverbal communication, including feasibility study and benefits. |
| Sprint 4 | 03/28       | Social impact study.                                                        |
| Sprint 5 | 04/11       | Solution architecture and public report development, detailing the processes carried out and results achieved. |

Throughout the sprints, we went through a process to better understand the problem that the solution will address. The solution is an artificial intelligence system that will generate pictograms from photos or text, with the aim of introducing new contexts for children and having a social impact by understanding the role of AI in communication and its accuracy. The first step was to determine if similar studies already exist in the market, as well as solutions. One reference found was the article by Mauricio Fontana de Vargas at McGill University, where a computer vision solution was developed to generate pictograms that tell stories from photographs.

In the next stage, the methodology was developed. Initially, a computer vision model was considered. However, due to limitations, it was changed to use a Multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), which has a broader pretrained repertoire and can better understand children's contexts compared to computer vision, where image descriptions are the only variable considered in the output.

In the social impact study phase, a discussion was held with Professor Marilia Othero (USP) to understand the project's viability and how its effectiveness can be tested and measured, contributing to autism studies for analysis. Additionally, we have initiated contact with Associação de Assistência a Criança Deficiente (AACD) to explore opportunities to expand the target audience to include children with cerebral palsy who also use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), specifically the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) methodology. Moreover to assess public potential and evaluate how the tool can be utilized, the Theory of Change framework was selected. This framework aims to understand the applied strategy, identify who will be impacted, and determine the intended outcomes resulting from the implemented changes. Finally, the solution architecture was built, identifying the initial modules of the solution and how integration will work for project execution and scalability.

## Conclusion

This project aims not only to innovate in the field of assistive technology but also to generate significant social impact in the lives of nonverbal autistic children. Through the use of AI, the goal is to facilitate communication for these children, promoting greater independence and integration in their social and educational interactions. A Multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) is used to expand the context of conversations and the expression of needs from a photo or text input.

Throughout the sprints, the work focused on understanding the needs of the target audience, identifying the best technological solutions, and designing a robust architecture that allows the proposal to scale. It is expected that the results of Module 1 will provide a solid foundation for the development of the next phases and that the project will significantly contribute to the inclusion of children with oral communication difficulties.
