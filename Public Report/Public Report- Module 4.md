# Module 4 – Validation, Ethics Approval, and Academic Submission

## Introduction

This module represents the final phase of the research project and focuses on the validation of results, ethical approval, and academic dissemination. At this stage, the study advanced from controlled testing and technical evaluation to direct interaction with nonverbal autistic children, enabling the validation of the proposed system in real educational and therapeutic contexts.

In parallel, all pending documentation was formally submitted to the Ethics Review Board. The approval granted during this phase authorized the continuation of the research with children and ensured that the study complied with ethical standards related to data protection, informed consent, and research involving vulnerable populations. Based on the validated results, the first complete version of the scientific article was written, presented to an academic examination committee, and subsequently submitted to *Communications of the ACM*.

This module consolidates the transition from system development to empirical validation and scientific communication, marking an important step toward broader academic and social impact.

## Development

The activities carried out in this module were centered on empirical validation, ethical regularization, and preparation for academic publication. Initially, the quantitative evaluation was strengthened by expanding the number of responses collected from AAC professionals, with the objective of increasing the reliability of the results and incorporating a wider range of professional perspectives.

Following this expansion, testing sessions were conducted with nonverbal autistic children. These sessions aimed to validate the system’s practical applicability by observing children’s engagement, interaction behavior, and use of the generated communication boards in meaningful contexts. The testing phase provided direct evidence of how the system performs as a complementary AAC tool in real-world scenarios.

At the same time, all outstanding requirements requested by the Ethics Review Board were addressed. After revisions and clarifications, formal ethical approval was obtained, authorizing both the execution of child-centered testing and the dissemination of the study’s findings. This approval was a necessary condition for advancing the research beyond exploratory evaluation.

Based on the collected results, the first full version of the scientific article was written, integrating quantitative data, qualitative observations, methodological details, and identified limitations. The work was then presented to an academic examination committee, whose feedback guided the refinement of the manuscript and presentation materials. In the final step of this module, the revised article was submitted to *Communications of the ACM*, completing the academic submission process.

## Work Schedule

The activities of Module 4 were organized into five sprints, each with clearly defined objectives related to validation, writing, presentation, and dissemination:

| Sprint | Start Date | Main Activities |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **Sprint 1** | 24/10 | Expansion of the quantitative evaluation sample with AAC professionals and preparation of a detailed project and submission plan. |
| **Sprint 2** | 07/11 | Writing of the first complete version of the scientific article and preparation of presentation materials. |
| **Sprint 3** | 21/11 | Refinement of the article and presentation based on internal reviews. |
| **Sprint 4** | 05/12 | Presentation to the academic examination committee and incorporation of required revisions. |
| **Sprint 5** | 18/12 | Preparation of the public report and definition of the submission strategy for journals and academic events, including submission to *Communications of the ACM*. |

This schedule ensured a structured progression from validation activities to academic evaluation and dissemination.

## Conclusion

Module 4 concludes the initial research cycle by combining empirical validation, ethical compliance, and academic submission. With the approval of the Ethics Review Board, the research can now continue in a more comprehensive manner, allowing the expansion of testing with a larger number of children and professionals. This expansion is essential for strengthening the generalization of the findings and for assessing the system’s performance across a broader range of contexts.

In addition to expanding the evaluation, this phase highlighted important opportunities for further improvement of the platform. Future work includes the introduction of a standardized reference document to support more consistent LLM responses, the creation of fine-tuning datasets to enable the use of open-source multimodal models, and additional prompt refinement to improve narrative coherence and semantic alignment.

Together, these directions support the evolution of the platform from a validated prototype into a more robust and generalizable research contribution, reinforcing its potential impact in educational and therapeutic AAC contexts.
